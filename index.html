				Cameroon and Brazil faced off in the final match of the group stage in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. While there wasn't a ton of scoring, it was an exciting game as both teams got off multiple shots on goal. In the second half it was more of the same, as both teams had shots on goal but couldn't convert. Cameroon would score in stoppage time as Vincent Aboubakar put in a goal but would receive his second yellow card for an excessive celebration. Cameroon won 1-0.
